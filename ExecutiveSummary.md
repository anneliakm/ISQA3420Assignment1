**MOTIVATION:** *Why the system is designed a certain way*

Managing a digital world can be a complex dimension with constant changes. With that being said, this system is designed to utilize Open Source Software to its potential. OSS is made to be reliable, efficient, and organized. That is only possible with a clearly designed system and excellent management. If both are in place, this system will create a stable OSS environment.
