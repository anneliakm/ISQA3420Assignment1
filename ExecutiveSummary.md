# Executive Summary

*Defined description of this project*

**MOTIVATION:** *Why the system is designed a certain way*

Managing a digital world can be a complex dimension with constant changes. With that being said, this system is designed to utilize Open Source Software to its potential. OSS is made to be reliable, efficient, and organized. That is only possible with a clearly designed system and excellent management. If both are in place, this system will create a stable OSS environment.


**ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND AUTHORITY AND CONTROL:** *Expected changes resulting from the new system*

The system is created with expected changes occuring as needed. Communication from developer to manager, and vise versa, is key for opitmal efficiency and organziation. The manager is the overseer in this system and is expected to maintain control over any modification as well as reviewing the final design. The developer is expected to be a creator and design new software while following the policies in the software. The developer is also expected to report to the manager when confirmation is necessary.

**SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY:** *Potential open source communities that would be engaged in this project*
